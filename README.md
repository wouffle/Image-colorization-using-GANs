Introduction :

Image colorization is the process of converting grayscale images into color images. Traditional methods required manual intervention and were time-consuming. Using GANs, we can automate this process and achieve high-quality, realistic colorizations.

How It Works :

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates colorized images from grayscale input, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of these images compared to real color images. Through adversarial training, both networks improve, resulting in realistic colorized outputs.
